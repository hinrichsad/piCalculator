        <h4>How does this work?</h4>
        <p>
            I am creating an imaginary 2d grid using 2 for loops, incrimenting x from 0 to 1 and for each incrementaton of x,
            doing the same for y. Within these for loops, we are getting random numbers between
            0 and 1 for both x and y. This essentially gives us a random X,Y coordinate. From here, we need to imagine a circle with a radius of 1,
            and work specifically within the quadrent 1 (We can multiply whatever results by 4 and it will apply to the whole)

        </p>

        <p>

            Now we can take our x and y coordinates and use the distance equation to see if the point falls within radius of the circle.(we can ignore one of the x and y since it starts at the origin)

        </p>

        <p>

            Basically if the distance is less than 1 then it is inside of the circle. so... <br>

            the radius can be calculated by <br>
            sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ---------- but you can ignore the sqrt because squaring any number less than 1 will equal a number less than 1 and any number greater than 1 squared will equal a number greater than 1.    
            <br><br>

            At this point we have a random point generator aaaand we can see if the random point is within the imaginary circle.
            <br> But how do we tie this to pi?
            <br><br>
            Well the area of a circle is defined by A = 4*pi*r^2. We have a constant of 4(refering to the 4 quadrents of the graph, of which we've made 1 with our code),
            r which we've decided to be 1(and 1^2 is just 1), finally A can be defined by the ratio of area of the graph within the circle over the total area of the graph.
            . <br><br>
            With a litte algebra we can manipulate the formula to be Pi = 4 * AreaRatio   .........    the AreaRatio = (A_inside_points/A_total_points)
            <br><br>
            
            Boooooooom! Lastly we need to throw that into js format and maniputlate the dom to show the answer! ---- Btw pi is 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679
